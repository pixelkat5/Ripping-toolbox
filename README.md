# Noesis by "Richard Whitehouse" [[DOWNLOAD]](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91 "Noesis home/download page")
"Noesis is a tool for previewing and converting between hundreds of model, image, and animation formats. It utilizes a robust plugin system, with support for native extension modules and Python scripts. The plugin/script API features hundreds of functions and interfaces which assist in developing new formats, tools, and visualization aids. Noesis also features processing, conversion, and visualization options for many different types of volume data, including medical imaging formats such as Analyze 7.5, NifTI-1, and DICOM."

Noesis is a great utility for converting things like .DDS files to .PNG's. It can also be used for viewing file types before you commit to converting something useless. Its also great as you can install plugins for formats that aren't already supported.
